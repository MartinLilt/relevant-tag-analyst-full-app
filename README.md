Requirements:
1) Excellent understanding and experience with dynamic JavaScript ES6 language.
2) Experience converting Figma & PSD to HTML + "Tailwind CSS. Good experience in using the Tailwind CSS framework.
3) High-quality code, clean code, optimized and non-redundant code, competent reuse of existing logic, and a good understanding of HTML tag semantics.
4) Excellent understanding of SPA application rendering principles and react-DOM elements. Experience with React.js, and Next.js frameworks.
5) Experience with Node.js + Express.js + JWT backend using MySQL database.
6) High understanding of REST APIs, and experience using them.

Description:
- In this case study, the client has set a task to create a full-stack JavaScript product with Upwork API integration and create a personal user interface for each client. The main objective of the product: To help freelancers better and faster analyze relevant search tags and trends of client queries.
Workflow: Conversion of PSD format into HTML code and Tailwind CSS styling (total time spent on the first phase: 42 hours). The second phase of work, developing Next.js frontend logic and integrating Upwork API using REST request technology (total time spent on the second phase: 67 hours + performance test and data output using Postman). The third phase is the development of Node.js + Express.js backend application logic. Working with JWT token (the registration process and logging user), connecting the database MySQL (total time spent on the third stage: 71 hours + basic test registration and logging modules, test data transfer server, and database). The fourth stage is the final MVP test of the product (the relationship between the frontend and backend (total time spent on the third stage: 6 hours + a basic test of registration and login modules, test data transfer server, and database)). A number of free edits: 2, paid edits: 11 (paid edits are the changes to be made after the contract opening).

Total time spent on the entire project: 186 hours.


The task:
- The first stage of the work:
1) PSD to HTML conversion using Tailwind CSS framework to style components.
2) Adapting javascript code for the Next.js framework and react-DOM.

- Second phase of work:
1) Developing frontend logic to use REST API requests.
2) Development of dynamic application logic and real-time interaction with the user interface.

- The third stage of work:
1) Development of backend logic for processing (CRUD and other...) queries and interaction with MySQL databases.
2) Setting up communication via (HTTP and HTTPS queries) server application (backend) and application interface (frontend).
